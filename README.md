## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view, create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.


## Usage

This app uses a Mongo database, Mongoose schema and Express. 

## Installation

Open a terminal and do a npm install
